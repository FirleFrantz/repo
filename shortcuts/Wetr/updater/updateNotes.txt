What's new in Wetr 0.9?
______________

Light Mode Revamp:
Light mode now is slightly more see through with a better blur.

• Changed some values in the shortcut to adjust the blur and saturation for Light mode.

• To accompany those changes, I updated the images on the server to better fit these new values.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!! If you used Light mode before, delete the Light theme folder and new images will download !!
