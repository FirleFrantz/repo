What's new in Wetr 0.5?
______________

• Shortcut no longer requires downloading Content.zip. It'll now download condition images for your selected theme as needed, and only if they haven't been used before.

• Dust & Smoke conditions added. This should fix some "CondImage" errors for English users.
