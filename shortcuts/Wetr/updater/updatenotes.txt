Wetr, shortcut and content update notes:



• Updated shortcut from 1 to 2
	- Needed to separate 12 & 12Pro directories.

• Updated content from 1 to 2 for all.
	- Toggles on 12 and 12 Pro locations vary by a few pixels. Jesus, Apple.
	- Had to upgrade 12 Pro version number even though nothing changed, because 12 was using 12Pro assets.
	- Update Light mode Theme.json to adjust blur and saturation levels. Images slightly more opaque.
